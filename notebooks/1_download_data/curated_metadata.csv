With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,2.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,18.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,21.0

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:Children's National Hospital,

This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth.

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.",collected_by:Clinical Microbiology University of Virginia Health System,4.0

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.",collected_by:Clinical Microbiology University of Virginia Health System,4.0

The fate and potential horizontal gene transfer of those genes into the host microbiome will have a crucial bearing on the eventual health risk of exposure to antibiotic resistance genes. In the present study, the effects of antibiotics on the in vivo transfer of 𝛽-lactam resistance genes were evaluated in a mouse model by characterizing the microbiome in excreted feces. Mice were dosed with Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovars Heidelberg or Bredeney referred to as donors. The in vivo transfer of the antibiotic resistance genes (blaTEM-1B, blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M1, etc.) from these donor bacteria to an exogenously introduced or endogenously present Escherichia coli strains (i.e. recipients) in the mouse gut was evaluated with or without a clinical dosage of ampicillin.",collected_by:Canadian Food Inspection Agency,6.0

Bacterial isolates with progressively higher levels of resistance were drawn from the patient at different time points. Later, these isolates were sequenced in order to identify the genetic determinants of the resistance. While all the isolates were sequenced on an Illumina platform, the last isolate to be drawn from the patient, called 56, was also sequenced on a PacBio platform.

Whole genome sequences (WGS) typically contain more information and allow to differentiate between closely related bacteria. With the increased possibilities of generating WGS and availability of the ensuing data, it is now possible to rapidly address taxonomic inconsistencies. Here we review the taxonomic history of the genus Enterobacter, by analyzing genome sequences from both publicly available sources and in-house genome sequences, if data on type strains was missing. Pre-standardized and validated WGS-based in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) >70% were used to delineate species. Our data indicate that 5 of 17 Enterobacter type species are misclassified as members of the genus Enterobacter, while E. muelleri is a synonym of E. asburiae. 89% of the analyzed Enterobacter species genomes, including 65 of 67 E. cloacae, 9 of 14 E. asburiae and three of three E. hormaechei were found to be misidentified. Moreover, isDDH indicates that the genus Enterobacter contains 15 novel species. The comprehensive genome-based taxonomic analysis subsequently enabled us to correctly identify or classify all hitherto unidentified strains within the genus Enterobacter. This study identified a large number of misclassifications among the known members of the genus Enterobacter and represents a WGS-based digital approach to accurately identify and classify strains within the genus Enterobacter.",,

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:Children's National Hospital,

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth.

We used fermentation characteristics, biochemical assays and fatty acid profiles for taxonomic analysis of EB-247T, and supplemented this with information derived from sub-genome- and genome- based analysis. Phenotypic and morphological tests revealed that the isolate is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, highly motile and facultatively anaerobic. Whole cell analysis showed that most of the fatty acids, with the exception of C17:0 Cyclo and C16:1ω6c/C16:1ω7c that were present in altered ratios, were typical for the Enterobacter species. We performed whole genome sequencing of EB-247T to perform subgenome-based phylogenetic analysis i.e. 16S rRNA, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and whole-genome-based taxonomic analysis. The draft genome of EB-247T was approximately 4.9 Mb in size with a G+C content of 56.0%. The 16S rDNA sequence of EB-247T showed > 97% similarity to all the Enterobacter species, while MLSA clustered EB-247T within Enterobacter but classified it as a separate species. Analysis using in silico DNA-DNA hybridization showed it had less than 70% sequence similarity with other Enterobacter species. The average nucleotide identity of EB-247T exhibited less than 95% sequence similarity to all the compared Enterobacter species supporting it’s a new species. From these results, we conclude that EB-247T possesses sufficient characteristics that are different from known Enterobacter species, and should be considered to be a novel species. The name Enterobacter bugandensis sp. nov. is proposed for isolate EB-247T (=DSM 29888T=NCCB 100573T).",,

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,19.0

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.",collected_by:Clinical Microbiology University of Virginia Health System,4.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,3.0

A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid.

This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,18.0

We used fermentation characteristics, biochemical assays and fatty acid profiles for taxonomic analysis of EB-247T, and supplemented this with information derived from sub-genome- and genome- based analysis. Phenotypic and morphological tests revealed that the isolate is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, highly motile and facultatively anaerobic. Whole cell analysis showed that most of the fatty acids, with the exception of C17:0 Cyclo and C16:1ω6c/C16:1ω7c that were present in altered ratios, were typical for the Enterobacter species. We performed whole genome sequencing of EB-247T to perform subgenome-based phylogenetic analysis i.e. 16S rRNA, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and whole-genome-based taxonomic analysis. The draft genome of EB-247T was approximately 4.9 Mb in size with a G+C content of 56.0%. The 16S rDNA sequence of EB-247T showed > 97% similarity to all the Enterobacter species, while MLSA clustered EB-247T within Enterobacter but classified it as a separate species. Analysis using in silico DNA-DNA hybridization showed it had less than 70% sequence similarity with other Enterobacter species. The average nucleotide identity of EB-247T exhibited less than 95% sequence similarity to all the compared Enterobacter species supporting it’s a new species. From these results, we conclude that EB-247T possesses sufficient characteristics that are different from known Enterobacter species, and should be considered to be a novel species. The name Enterobacter bugandensis sp. nov. is proposed for isolate EB-247T (=DSM 29888T=NCCB 100573T).",,18.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",,19.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:University of Louisville,6.0

Culturing efforts coupled with whole genome sequencing of the gastrointestinal bacteria can address key questions that are computationally non-trivial using shotgun metagenomics alone. This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

The infection spanned about 10 months, from the onset of the infection to the death of the patient. During that time, the infection evolved resistance to the multiple antibiotics used to treat it, including the very important class of carbapenems. Bacterial isolates with progressively higher levels of resistance were drawn from the patient at different time points. Later, these isolates were sequenced in order to identify the genetic determinants of the resistance. While all the isolates were sequenced on an Illumina platform, the first isolate to be drawn from the patient, called 24, was also sequenced on a PacBio platform. Because both PacBio and Illumina reads were available, the de novo assembly of the reads from 24 yielded a complete ungapped genomic sequence, consisting of a chromosome and three plasmids. The complete genomic sequence of 24 was used as a template for the assembly of the Illumina reads from the other isolates.","collected_by:Robert Wood, MD",6.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,7.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,15.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,12.0

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth.

This comprehensive gut microbiota-derived bacterial genome collection provides the basis to improve the taxonomic classification resolution of metagenomic analysis, and to allow subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments on host physiology and gut colonisation process. To get a broad and comprehensive coverage of the gut microbiota, we cultivated bacterial species from human faecal samples on different selectice agar media and broth.

Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater. These findings suggest possible optimization strategies for reactor design such as improved aerobic/anaerobic partitioning and elimination of organic carbon from reactor feed.;derived from metagenome",sample_type:metagenomic assembly,

Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance.",collected_by:Clinical Microbiology University of Virginia Health System,16.0

Whole genome sequences (WGS) typically contain more information and allow to differentiate between closely related bacteria. With the increased possibilities of generating WGS and availability of the ensuing data, it is now possible to rapidly address taxonomic inconsistencies. Here we review the taxonomic history of the genus Enterobacter, by analyzing genome sequences from both publicly available sources and in-house genome sequences, if data on type strains was missing. Pre-standardized and validated WGS-based in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) >70% were used to delineate species. Our data indicate that 5 of 17 Enterobacter type species are misclassified as members of the genus Enterobacter, while E. muelleri is a synonym of E. asburiae. 89% of the analyzed Enterobacter species genomes, including 65 of 67 E. cloacae, 9 of 14 E. asburiae and three of three E. hormaechei were found to be misidentified. Moreover, isDDH indicates that the genus Enterobacter contains 15 novel species. The comprehensive genome-based taxonomic analysis subsequently enabled us to correctly identify or classify all hitherto unidentified strains within the genus Enterobacter. This study identified a large number of misclassifications among the known members of the genus Enterobacter and represents a WGS-based digital approach to accurately identify and classify strains within the genus Enterobacter.",,

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.",collected_by:DSMZ,19.0
